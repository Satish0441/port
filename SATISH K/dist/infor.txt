A Bit About Me

My passion for designing spans across various tools and platforms, which allows me to bring my creative ideas to life. With Figma, I focus on designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring that every project is not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional. 

Beyond UI/UX design, I have a deep interest in designing PCB's using Autodesk software. Whether it's Autodesk or Eagle, I enjoy the process of creating innovative and precise designs that streamline product development. I strive to deliver unique and impactful solutions that make a difference in the world of technology and design.

When I'm not occupied with my regular academics work I enjoy playing football, taking photos  watching anime, and exploring new technologies.
